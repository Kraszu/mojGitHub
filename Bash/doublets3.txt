Write a bash script with a function that accepts a file as parameter.  

The function should double space the lines in the file and write the output to a new file as well as to the standard output. 

Ensure in the body of the script that it is being called with the correct number of arguments. 

Also ensure that the file is readable before attempting to double space. 

 Properly comment your code.
